    <p>I'm Cecil and I like to dream a lot. Sadly, none of the dreams will ever come true. But you know what? It's okay. You can always try your best and get very close to your dreams. Don't stop trying.</p>
    <p>My very first nickname was <strong>STALKER_27</strong> that I created back in 2010. Everyone kept asking what it meant and the truth is that I just thought of a random word that I didn't know the meaning of and added a random number to it. Then, in a slow course of two years (2014-2016) I switched to <strong>ST27</strong> because it was much more simple.</p>
    <p>But then I decided that this name was very short and and even more meaningless so I started experimenting. One of the variations that I came up with is <strong>27 Crazy Weebs</strong> and I think it's much better than just two random letters and a number that surprisingly appears everywhere nowadays for some reason.</p>
    <p>But now I'm Dreamy Cecil because that's who I am.</p>

  <h1 style="position: relative; top: 16px;">What is this dark place?</h1>
  
  <div class="siteBlock">
    <p>Welcome to the void filled with meaningless darkness. Just kidding, this is too edgy.</p>
    <p>This is, basically, my little portfolio site or something with everything I do that you might find interesting. <em>In case you are actually interested...</em></p>
    <p>My hobbies include a lot of things. That might be the reason why I'm so bad at all of them. (&not;_&not;)</p>
    </p><strong>I like:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Music (FL Studio 12)</li>
      <li>Drawing (mostly designs or pixel art that I make with Paint.NET)</li>
      <li><span style="color: #BBD1EB;">This color</span> (RGB: #BBD1EB)</li>
      <li>Editing videos in Sony Vegas Pro 13 (not many occasions)</li>
      <li>Making games (mostly experiments in GameMaker Studio 2)</li>
      <li>C++ Programming (I have some experience but only with syntax, I'm using Visual Studio 2013)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not too much into web design but I learned some things as you can see. Everything was writen by hand with Notepad++ and a bit of googling.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h1 style="position: relative; top: 16px;">In conclusion</h1>
  <div class="siteBlock">
    <p style="text-align: center;">You can explore the site, if you want. Maybe you'll find something interesting.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">There's really nothing much to say about me, so... Welcome to my world.</p>
