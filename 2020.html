  <h1>Accomplishments of 2020</h1>
  <div embed-html="https://DreamyCecil.github.io/top_menu.html"></div>
  <script src="https://DreamyCecil.github.io/html_embed.js"></script>
  
  <h1 style="position: relative; top: 16px;">A list of what I've achieved in 2020.</h1>
  
  <div class="siteBlock">
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">It's been a long and rough year. But despite that, I've managed to do something big and great. Much bigger and greater than some of the previous years. So, here we go.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <ul>
      <li>One of the things you're looking at right now - the site redesign. Before, it's been pretty rough and dark, with not that much content. But now, I've added a lot of <a href="https://dreamycecil.github.io/sam/files">new projects</a>, <a href="https://dreamycecil.github.io/sam/gallery">screenshots</a> and even made some <a href="https://dreamycecil.github.io/links">fancy links</a>!</li>
      
    </ul><hr><ul>
      
      <li>Next things on the list are related to the site, because they're hosted on the same platform - <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil">GitHub</a>.</li>
      
      <p>1. The biggest projects I'm proud of are, of course, <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SeriousSam_SDK107">Serious Sam SDK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SeriousSam_CustomEntitiesLib">Custom Entities Library</a> for new Visual Studios. Very nice and modern environment for good old mod making.</p>
      
      <p>2. Another project which I'm proud of starting this year is a direct successor to my old Advanced Multiplayer mod - <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/AdvancedMultiplayer2">Advanced Multiplayer 2</a>! Which is at the time of writing is still in development, with the first public beta already available for download.</p>
      <div embed-html="sam/files/amp2-d.html"></div>
      
      <p>3. Other, not so unimportant projects, are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyStructures">Dreamy Structures</a> - my own implementation of array, list, map and stack structures on pure C++.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyJSON">Dreamy JSON</a> - a self-made JSON config parser with Dreamy Structures in its base.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Maybe these projects are not the greatest, but they have been a great learning curve for myself and I find them very useful for my own projects (one of which is Advanced Multiplayer 2).</p>
      
      <p>4. And finally, a couple of programs that I made as experiments with Windows Forms, a simple minesweeper game and a mouse cursor trapper.</p>
      <div embed-html="projects/files/winforms-d.html"></div>
      
    </ul><hr><ul>
    
      <li>Moving forward to projects that aren't on GitHub but still coded by me - Serious Sam mods.</li>
      
      <p>This year has probably been the most Serious Sam projects-filled ever. So many projects have been started and even released. You know about Advanced Multiplayer 2 already, how about a few more:</p>
      
      <ul>
      
        <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.github.io/sam/files/hl2-im">Half-Life 2 Immersion Mod</a> - not exactly this year's project, but released in August 2020. An experiment that grew into something amazing that I didn't even expect myself. Not a full version yet but who knows, maybe it will be in 2021.</li>
        <div embed-html="sam/files/hl2-im-d.html"></div>
        
        </br>
        
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cZeNj7nS0shMIKHgTB3Tz9es4rHYgRu9/view?usp=sharing">Tiny Mod Pack</a> - this project grew out of several small experimental mods that I've been trying to make. It got frozen when I switched to another project without finishing a couple of mods that would be in this mod pack. Not-so-publicly released on some Discord server, this beta version of Tiny Mod Pack contains 3 out of 5 planned mods: Randomized, Shrunk and Shuffled.</li>
        <div embed-html="sam/files/tmp-d.html"></div>
        
        </br>
        
        <li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/726537272874237962/758430390762471495/EntityReplacementPack_20200923.zip">Entity Replacement Pack</a> - another Discord-exclusive experiment of trying to make an entity pack that isn't tied to vanilla entities for customizing enemies, items and projectiles. The pack has also been unfinished and abandoned and so it can be pretty buggy. Uses an earlier version of Dreamy JSON for loading model configs. Includes a test map that showcases most of the replacers' features (the grenade launcher uses a custom picked mask value making it unpickable by the second player in multiplayer specifically). <strong>If you wish to use it in your own map in this state, use it at your own risk.</strong></li>

      <li>Enough talking, let's relax and watch something.</li>
      
    </ul>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Here are a few funnies I've uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamyCecil">YouTube</a> this year.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Don't like YouTube? Then how about my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cutieinahoodie">Twitch</a> channel? I've been streaming more than ever this year and I'm not going to stop here!</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Here are a couple of my highlights, the Halloween and Christmas streams:</p>

    <hr><ul>
    
      <li>Music is an amazing activity but a very tricky one. It seemed like I was struggling with it the most this year. But I've managed to make something nice. Not without a few memes, of course.</li>
      
    </ul>
    
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Enjoy!</p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">And now my favorite musical projects this year:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">We Are Number One mashup and an original HOME-inspired <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dreamycecil/sets/daydreaming">Daydreaming album</a>!</p>

      <li>Another art activity I sometimes enjoy is... Digital art. I haven't been drawing as of much this year but still managed to release a couple of nice illustrations.</li>

    <hr>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">And that's pretty much it. If I forgot something as usual, I'll add it with another GitHub commit later. But as of now, these are my accomplishments of the year 2020.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Thanks to everyone who sticked with me during this horrible year. Let's leave it as the worst year of this century. Or at least the decade.</p>
