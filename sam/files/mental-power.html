    <p>In the year 2105 the man called Sam Stone travelled back in time so he could stop alien invasion to Earth. Sam was able to defeat the enemy of the whole universe - Mental - and finally stop the invasion. He travelled back to Earth and went forward in time. But, after Sam got back Mental wasn't dead, so he continued destroying everything. Sam wanted to finally take a break and relax far away in a little town but after finding out that Mental is still alive decides to get to him as soon as possibe to finally take his power ...over the Universe!</p>
    <p>Unfinished mod that was in development since 2011 but died in 2014 because of the lack of ideas. This version contains a 2011-2012 campaign (8 completed + 1 unfinished maps) and a 2014 campaign (19 maps and a bunch of weird levels), and of course a few useless Deathmatch maps. Both campaigns are suitable for a cooperative play.</p>
    <p>No maps were significantly changed, everything was just polished so it would at least start (cannot guarantee crash-free games). Also you can't change the game mode in the "Start Server" because I broke something.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: The name of this mod was supposed to be something like &quot;Mental's Power Over The Universe&quot; but my English wasn't that great back in the day.</p>
