    <p>Sam has to retreive an ancient Sirian artifact that was detected by researchers on some far desert island. The previous groups were sent to this mission before but failed to return. Sam discovers that Mental has ambushed the island already and possibly got ahold of the artifact himself and won't give it away without a fight!</p>
    <p>The map was made for a Treasure World map contest in 2016 and took the 4th place out of 7 maps.</p>
