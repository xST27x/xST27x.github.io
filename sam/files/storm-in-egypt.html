    <p>Sam is an average guy on vacation in Egypt. He lives in his own small house that he got from his grandfather near one of the temples. But one day a storm approaches! Sam doesn't understand what's going on because he's never seen a storm like this in Egypt before. He decides to head to the temple in order to find survivors. The story takes place in the year 2095.</p>
    <p>The map was made in only two days and takes about 5-6 minutes to finish.</p>
